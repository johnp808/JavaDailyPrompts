# Most Common Vowel

### 7-9-25

## Goal: Create a program that identifies the most frequently occurring vowel in a given sentence.

# Prompt: Write a program that reads a sentence from the user and determines which vowel appears most frequently. If there's a tie, display all the most common vowels in the order they appear.

## Accept a sentence from the user.

## Count only vowels: a, e, i, o, u (case-insensitive).

## Ignore non-letter characters.

## If no vowels are present, output an appropriate message.

## If multiple vowels are tied with the highest frequency, print all of them in the order they first appear.
