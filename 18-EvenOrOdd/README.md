# Even Or Odd

### 6-8-25

## Goal: Practice working with loops, conditionals, and input validation. Reinforce understanding of parity (even/odd) and number sign (positive/negative), while maintaining program state across multiple user runs.

# Prompt

## Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd, and also determines if it is positive or negative. The program should prompt the user to enter a number (not zero), then print out whether the number is a positive even, negative even, positive odd, or negative odd number. After each check, the user should be asked whether they want to enter another number.

### Identifies and displays whether the number is:
### Positive Even
### Negative Even
### Positive Odd
### Negative Odd

### Handles invalid entries gracefully with input validation.

### Repeats until the user chooses to exit.
