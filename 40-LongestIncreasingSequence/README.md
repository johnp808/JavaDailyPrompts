# Longest Increasing Sequence

### 7-13-25

## Goal: Extract the longest increasing sequence of consecutive letters from a given string, ignoring case and non-letter characters.

# Prompt: Write a Java program that reads a sentence and finds the longest increasing sequence of consecutive alphabet characters. A sequence is considered increasing if each next character comes after the previous in the alphabet (e.g., a b c, f g h), ignoring case. The longest such sequence should be returned.

## A single line sentence

## Case-insensitive

## Ignore non-letter characters

## Consider only sequences where letters appear consecutively in the input string

## The longest increasing letter sequence

## If multiple sequences have the same length, return the first one

## If no increasing sequence is found, output a message
