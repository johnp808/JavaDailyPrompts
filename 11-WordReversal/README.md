# Word Reversal

### 6-1-25

## Goal: Write a method that takes a string input and reverses the order of the words. Words are separated by spaces. Do not reverse the characters in the wordsâ€”just the order of the words.

# Prompt

### Extra spaces between words should be trimmed.

### Leading/trailing spaces should be removed in the output.

### Try to do it without using built-in methods like String.split() (if you want an extra challenge).
