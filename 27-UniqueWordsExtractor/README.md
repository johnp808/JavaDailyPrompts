# Unique Words Extractor

### 6-19-25

## Goal: Practice working with Set, input validation, and character filtering.

# Prompt Write a program that takes a sentence as input and extracts all unique words, ignoring case. Words should be output in the order they appear. A word is defined as a sequence of letters separated by spaces. The user should be able to enter multiple sentences in one session.

### Prompts the user for a sentence.
### Identifies words composed of alphabetic characters only.
### Ignores case when determining uniqueness (e.g., "The" and "the" are treated as the same).
### Maintains the original appearance of the first unique occurrence (preserves casing and order).
### Avoids using the same word twice in the output.
### Repeats until the user chooses to exit.
### Resets all stored data between runs.
