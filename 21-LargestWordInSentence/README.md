# Largest Word Finder

### 6-13-25

## Goal: Practice working with strings, loops, conditionals, and array structures. Reinforce understanding of how to parse a sentence and identify the largest word by character count.

# Prompt Write a program that accepts a sentence from the user and returns the largest word found in that sentence. A word is defined as a continuous sequence of alphabetic characters (A–Z or a–z). Non-letter characters should be ignored and treated as word boundaries. After displaying the result, the user should be asked whether they want to enter another sentence.

### Prompts user to enter a sentence.

### Ignores non-letter characters (e.g., punctuation, numbers, symbols).
