# Word Frequency Counter

### 6-14-25

## Goal: Strengthen skills in string processing, looping through arrays or collections, and counting occurrences using basic Java logic.

# Prompt Write a program that asks the user to enter a sentence and then calculates how many times each word appears. The program should ignore punctuation and be case-insensitive (e.g., “Hello” and “hello” count as the same word). At the end, display each unique word and its corresponding count.
