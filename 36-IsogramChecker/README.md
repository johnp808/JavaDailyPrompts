# Isogram Checker

### 7-8-25

## Goal: Determine if a word or sentence is an isogram (no repeating letters).

# Prompt Write a program that checks if the provided word or sentence is an isogram, meaning no letter repeats. Ignore spaces and punctuation. Treat uppercase and lowercase letters as the same.

## Input: a word or sentence (string).

## Ignore case and non-letter characters..

## Only alphabetic characters are considered (ignore spaces, punctuation, digits, etc.).

## Case-insensitive: "Machine" and "machine" are treated the same.

## Non-letter characters (spaces, hyphens, punctuation, digits) are ignored.

## It's okay if the input includes symbols â€” only alphabetic characters matter.

## An empty string or a string with no letters (like "123!@#" or "---") is considered a valid isogram.
