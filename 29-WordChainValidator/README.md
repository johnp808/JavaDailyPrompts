# Word Length Classifier

### 6-21-25

## Goal: Validate a chain of words where each word starts with the last letter of the previous word.

# Prompt Write a program that takes a sentence of words and checks if it forms a valid word chain. A word chain is valid if each word begins with the last letter of the previous word.

## Input Requirements:

### A sentence with two or more words.
### Words are separated by spaces.
### Ignore punctuation.
### Ignore case.

## Output Expectations:

### Print whether the chain is valid or not.
### Show where the chain breaks if it's invalid.

## Edge Case Handling:

### Only one word → output: “Not enough words to form a chain.”
### Empty input → prompt user again.
