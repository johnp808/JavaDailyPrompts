# Fibonacci Number Generator

### 6-8-25

## Goal: Practice working with loops, conditionals, and input validation. Reinforce understanding of number sequences and how to maintain application state across multiple user runs.

# Prompt

## Create a program that takes a positive integer input n and generates the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. Allow the user to input multiple times, and handle invalid inputs gracefully.

### Prompts user for a positive integer.

### Displays the corresponding number of Fibonacci numbers.

### Handles edge cases (n = 1, n = 2, n > 2) correctly.

### Repeats until the user chooses to exit.

### Input validation for non-integer or invalid entries.

### Resets values between runs to avoid carryover.
