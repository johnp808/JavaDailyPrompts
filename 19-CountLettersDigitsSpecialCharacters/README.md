### 6-9-25

## Goal: Practice string parsing and character classification using loops and conditionals. Strengthen familiarity with Character class methods and custom counters.

# Prompt

## Write a program that prompts the user to enter a sentence. The program should count and display how many letters, digits, and special characters are in the sentence (excluding whitespace). After displaying the results, the user should be asked if they want to enter another sentence.

### Prompts the user to enter a sentence or phrase.
### Iterates through each character of the string.
### Uses Character.isLetter() and Character.isDigit() to identify character types.
### Any non-letter, non-digit, non-space character is counted as a special character.

### Displays the counts for:
### Total letters
### Total digits
### Total special characters

### Repeats until the user selects to exit.
