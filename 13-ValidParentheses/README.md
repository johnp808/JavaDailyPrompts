### 6-3-25

## Goal: To create a program that validates whether a given string containing parentheses (), square brackets [], and curly braces {} is properly balanced and nested. This helps reinforce understanding of stack data structures, character traversal, and conditional logic.

# Prompt

### A string is valid if: 
### Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
### Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
