# Count Vowels and Consonants

### 6-12-25

## Goal: Practice string manipulation, character classification, and loop logic by counting vowels and consonants in user-provided input.

# Prompt

## Write a program that prompts the user to enter a sentence. The program should count and display the total number of vowels and consonants in the sentence. It should repeat this process until the user chooses to exit.

### Prompts the user for a sentence of any length.
### Ignores case (both uppercase and lowercase letters are valid).
### Only letters are counted â€” digits, punctuation, and spaces are ignored.
### Vowels considered: a, e, i, o, u.
### Handles empty or invalid input with appropriate messaging.
### Loops until the user chooses to stop.
### Resets counts between runs to avoid carryover.
