### 6-22-25

## Goal: Calculate and report the ratio of consonants to vowels in a given sentence.

# Prompt Write a Java program that asks the user to enter a sentence and calculates how many vowels and consonants it contains. Then display the consonant-to-vowel ratio, rounded to two decimal places.

## Input Requirements:

### A sentence containing letters, spaces, and possibly symbols (you should ignore anything that's not a letter).
### Treat letters as case-insensitive.
### Treat letters as case-insensitive.
### Avoid dividing by zero (handle input with no vowels gracefully).

### "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!"

## Output Expectations:

### Number of vowels: 11
### Number of consonants: 24
### Ratio (Consonants : Vowels): 2.18
