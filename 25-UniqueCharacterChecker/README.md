# Unique Character Checker

### 6-17-25

## Goal: Practice working with Set, loops, and string manipulation. Reinforce understanding of how to identify and track unique characters in a string.

# Prompt Write a program that checks whether a given word contains all unique characters (i.e., no repeating characters). The user will enter a single word, and your program will return whether the word contains all unique letters.

### Prompt the user to enter a single word (no spaces).
### If the input is invalid (contains numbers, symbols, or spaces), ask again.
### Check if all characters in the word are unique.
### Print the result: "All characters are unique." or "Duplicate characters found."
### Ask if the user wants to check another word.
